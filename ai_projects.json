      "context": "I led a multi-phase infrastructure upgrade upgrade of Veritas NetBackup (8.2 to 10.5) and RHEL (7.5 to 8.5) across multiple mission-critical data platforms. The work involved coordinating with 6+ cross-functional teams (DBAs, infra, network, security, app owners), resolving compatibility and performance issues, planning rollback strategies, and running dry runs. Also utilized LEAPP for OS migrations and validating backup integrity achieving zero data loss. We executed the migration with zero data loss and significantly improved reliability, monitoring, and compliance for backup platforms. Estimated savings were $200K+ annually from reduced failures, support calls, and manual interventions. I also achieved recognition from senior leadership for this project",
